# Fancy-Color-Picker
Various Utils for Godot (currently includes an advanced color picker)

Fancy Color Picker features:
- Select a color and find closest known color match
- Use this to map every pixel on the picking canvas to a known color
- Draw outlines between the areas on the picking canvas
- *Do all of the above fast enough to allow immediate redraw on each change of third color-space dimension*
- 3d Cube view - be able to see the points in 3d space, as well as cross-section of an arbitrary plane through the color-space cube (work in progress)
